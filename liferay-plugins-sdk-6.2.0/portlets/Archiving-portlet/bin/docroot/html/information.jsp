<p>GFBio will provide two ways for data submission.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One option will be to upload your data to the GFBio portal and to use the tools for data analyze and aggregation. They will allow you to combine your data with the portal's search results and visualization. Providing the typical functions of a GIS (Geographical Information System), the visualization will also offer additional data evaluation and analysis tools. Your data will be only accessible for you; we do not send it to a long-term data storage without your acceptance. For further processing, you will be able to download the results and continue working locally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A section opportunity will be to use the portal's workflow for archiving data. Successfully submitted to the long-term data storage, the data it is accessible to the public. The workflow will guide you through the entire submission process and finally will recommend a suitable data storage. Due to individual requirements and heterogeneous data, you will have to get in contact with the data curator. After successful negotiations, you will come to an agreement and you can sent the data to a long-term data storage. Please be aware that data submission may take some time. Thus, we recommend contacting us in an early stage of your project to ensure the data compatibility. However, you will be able to submit your data when the project is over. Then our helpdesk will support you in converting the data into a GFBio-conform structure.</p>

<p>All our project partners have the aim of long-term preservation and data accessibility, but every data storage covers different disciplines in biodiversity and has its own data policy. An <strong>Archive</strong> is a long-term data storage with a focus on the technical quality of data. Scientific quality has to be guaranteed by the researcher. <strong>Data Center</strong> are museums and collections preserving digital and non-digital objects. Active research on these is an important part of the center work. <strong>M<strong>olecular Databases</strong></strong> do not save the actual sequence information. These data go to the EBI/ENA. It manages, maintains and expands the descriptive information of the respective sequence information and works very closely with collections and archives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, this work package is under construction and the first results will be available 2015.<br />
Please contact the long-term storage directly if you want submit your data for archiving.</p>
